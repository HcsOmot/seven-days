# Day 3 - PostgreSQL
Next, we looked at [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)! Follow along in [our tutorial](http://developer.ibm.com/clouddataservices/2016/10/05/7-databases-7-days-postgresql/).

## Running the samples

We have included a few really simple samples that show how to connect to PostgreSQL from a number of popular languages (Node.JS, PHP, Python and Go). There is more information in the article about how to get up and running with these languages.
